***Overview:***

This project aims to create an engaging text-based adventure game using C#. The player will explore a series of interconnected rooms, each described through evocative text. They'll interact with objects within these rooms, solve puzzles, and make choices that influence the narrative's progression. Combat encounters with simple enemy AI will add an element of challenge.

Team: Braeden Connors, Jacob Peacy

***Minimum Viable Product (MVP):***

The core game experience will be delivered in the MVP. This includes:

Room navigation: Players move between rooms based on textual descriptions and available exits.
Object interaction: Players can examine, take, use, and drop objects within the game world.
Choice-driven narrative: The story branches based on player decisions, leading to different outcomes.
Basic combat: Simple turn-based combat against enemies with rudimentary AI.
File I/O: Room descriptions and object interactions will be loaded from external files for ease of content creation and modification.

***Stretch Goals:***

Beyond the MVP, we aim to enhance the game with the following stretch goals:
Save/Load System: Allow players to save their progress and resume their adventure later.
Advanced Puzzles: Implement more complex puzzles involving item combinations, code-breaking, or logic challenges.
Procedural Generation: Explore procedural generation of maps or storylines to increase replayability and offer a more dynamic experience.
GUI Enhancements: Move beyond pure text by incorporating simple graphical elements (e.g., images, icons) and sound effects to enhance the atmosphere and immersion.
